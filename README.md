## 🌸 About Me

I’m a second-year Software Engineering student with a strong interest in Data Engineering and data-driven system design.

As I progress in my academic journey, I’ve become increasingly fascinated by how data flows through systems — from database schema design and backend structures to building reliable backend structures that support scalable data pipelines.

I am continuously working on strengthening my foundations in algorithms, system design, and database architecture, aiming to grow into a well-rounded backend and data-focused engineer.

I believe structured data reflects structured thinking — and I’m committed to refining both.
